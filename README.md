[![Demo](https://github.com/rodydavis/lit-code-editor/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rodydavis/lit-code-editor/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Ideas

- We need a common config for monaco (base packe / utility)
- Monaco Editor with language server must not have the workers and other extended capabilities (different package)
- Monaco Editor without language server gets all capabilities (different package)
